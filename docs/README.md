# LoopDeeDoo
The central development repo for the LoopDeeDoo language.
***
LoopDeeDoo aims to be the dumbest, most ridiculous proramming language on the scene. The entire language centers around its looping mechanic which works by calling `loop dee doo ("some string of characters")`. The loop runs for every letter in the provided string.
